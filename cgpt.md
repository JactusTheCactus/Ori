# World History
- There was once a whole pantheon of deities
	- They were killed in the Orvaźirion, with Orvaź, he who started the war, being the sole survivor
		- Orvaź is forgotten by mortals
- Orvaź is/was the `God of War, Death, Hate & Cataclysm`
# Plot
- Starts `5 Millennia` after the _Orvaźirion_
	- Orvaź is believed to have been killed, like the rest of `The Old Gods`
- The God of War of `The New Gods`, _Írlaj_, is attempting to start another `Orvaźirion`
- After a year and a half, the party are finally confronting Írlaj
	- Írlaj absolutely curb-stomps them
	- Írlaj is preparing to finish off the party
		- monologuing, super-villain style
	- Írlaj puts a massive earth-spike through Jules' chest, killing her instantly, laughing as her blood spewed from her chest, painting his face
		- The spike is `2/3` the width of her body
			- It goes clean through her spine
		- Ori laughs, broken, __manic__
			- >Do you think you're a God?
				>
				>Do you have any idea what it's like to be a God?
		- After exactly one hour of Ori speaking (exactly as long as the Orvaźirion), it dawns on Írlaj; `Orione del Corvo` is __`Orvaź`__
			- The God of War, The architect of the Írlajan, The breaker of worlds, is __terrified__
				- Írlaj has angered the most dangerous being in existence
					- It has spent the last 5,000 years masquerading as a mortal, hoping it could live in peace
						- Írlaj has spent 18 months destroying that peace
							- Ori's friends lay dying, his fianceé _dead_, and Írlaj is responsible
								- Orvaź wouldn't _dream_ of mercy, of making this moment quick. __Not For Írlaj__
									- >I once ended the world in an hour.
										>
										>It's taken you 18 months.
										>
										>If there is anything above you other than me, I suggest you pray to it.
										>
										>. . .
										>
										>__This going to take a while.__
			- Emil, Jules, and Nat had no idea
				- They have never heard of "Orvaź" or the "Orvaźirion"
