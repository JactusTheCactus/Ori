# Ori Character Visualization
This project visualizes the character "Ori del Corvo" using an HTML page with a dynamically generated flowchart powered by [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/). It also includes a Markdown file describing the character's traits and setting.
## Project Structure
- `ori.html`
    - The main HTML file for the visualization
- `ori.md`
    - A Markdown file describing the character and setting
### Files
- **[ori.md](ori.md)**: Contains a structured description of the character "Ori" and the fantasy setting.
- **[ori.html](ori.html)**: Generates a flowchart and displays the character's name and phonetic details using Mermaid.js and JavaScript.
## Features
1. **Character Description**:
   - The `ori.md` file outlines Ori's personality, hidden traits, and role in the setting.
1. **Dynamic Flowchart**:
   - The `ori.html` file uses Mermaid.js to render a flowchart that visualizes the breakdown of Ori's name and its components.
1. **Custom Styling**:
   - The HTML file includes custom CSS for a clean and bold presentation.
1. **Dynamic Title and Content**:
   - The page dynamically sets the document title and displays the character's name in a capitalized format.
## Development Notes
- The `capitalize` function in the JavaScript ensures proper capitalization of the character's name.
- The flowchart is defined using Mermaid.js syntax and dynamically injected into the HTML.
## Future Enhancements
- Add more detailed visualizations for Ori's traits and backstory.
- Integrate the content of `ori.md` into the HTML dynamically.
- Expand the flowchart to include more relationships and details about the setting.
